      <h3>Automated Exoplanet Transit Detection and Vetting to Build Unbiased Samples for Demographics</h3>
      <p>
      I am currently a Southeastern University Research Assoc. (SURA) Postbac Researcher at Goddard Space Flight Center 
      working with Dr. Elisa Quintana and Dr. Robby Wilson. My project is focused on helping develop TraSHDUMP (TRAnsits with any Stellar Host Detected with an Unbiased Matched-filter Pipeline) 
      and RECYCLEBin (Removal of Exoplanet Candidates Yearning to be Condoned as Lookalikes and Eclipsing BINaries), automated pipelines 
      for the detection and vetting of exoplanet candidates, respectively. We will be applying TraSHDUMP and RECYCLEBin 
      to the original 200,000 Kepler light curves as well as an additional 400,000 light curves from background stars 
      captured in the spacecraftâ€™s field of view. This project is set to significantly expand the Kepler transiting planet sample, 
      leading to more precise and complete occurrence rate estimates for small planets, and can additionally be applied to
      TESS, K2, and Plato.

      <h3><a href="RAVEYSO_Moquin_poster_final_new copy.pdf" target="_blank">Accretion and Wind Variability of T Tauri Stars Diagnosed through H-alpha Variations</a></h3>
      <p>
        During summer 2024 and my senior year at Rice University, I worked with Dr. Chris Johns-Krull for my senior thesis. 
        I explored the variability in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) by analyzing high-resolution spectroscopic data. 
        Specifically, I studied the H-alpha emission line at 6562.817 Angstroms, which serves as a tool to examine the 
        relationship between accretion and wind processes. The location of the launching mechanisms for these winds
         is a subject of significant debate in literature. To analyze this variability, I applied several techniques aimed at identifying and characterizing 
         variability and their origins, such as periodograms, Principal Component Analysis, and Correlation Matrices. I presented my work as a poster
         at the Gulf Coast Research Symposium and at "The Role of Accretion and Ejection Variability in the Evolution of Young Stars and their Disks" (RAVEYSO) Workshop. 
         I am currently working on adding the Forbidden Oxygen emission line at 6300 Angstroms to further analyze the variability of two CTTSs BP Tau and CI Tau. 
         A paper on my results is currently in prep.

      <h3><a href="final_localizing_flares_poster.pdf" target="_blank">Localizing Stellar Activity on Low-Mass Stars with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a></h3>
      <p>
        During  summer 2023, I was an intern at Goddard Space Flight Center working with Dr. Josh Schlieder and Jordan Ealy. 
        My project was on localizing stellar activity on low-mass stars using TESS 120s SPOC calibrated data. 
        I created and cleaned my sample of light curves using Lightkurve and localized flares using AltaiPony. 
        My clean sample consisted of K and M stars from five nearby moving groups: Beta Pictoris, AB Doradus, Tucana-Horologium, 
        Columba, and Carina, spanning ages ~ 20 to 150 Myr.
        I presented my findings on the relationship between spot modulation and flare activity as a poster at the Conference for 
        Undergraduate Women in Physics, 243rd Meeting of the American Astronomical Society,
        and Cool Stars 22. I continued to work on my research after my internship 
        until I  published my findings in Research Notes of the AAS in May 2024.

      <h3><a href="https://juliemoqs.github.io/categorizing-ngc4438/" target="_blank">Categorizing NGC4438 Using Color Gradients</a></h3>
      <p>
        During Spring semester 2023, I had to design my own research project idea, collect my data virtually using McDonald Observatory's 
        .8 m telescope, and reduce and analyze the data using IRAF, Python, and SAOImageDS9 for my astronomy lab class at Rice University. 
        My project was focused on categorizing NGC4438, a strange shaped galaxy, using color gradients.

      <h3><a href="Mapping_Molecular_Clouds_Near_M17.pdf" target="_blank">Mapping Molecular Clouds Near M17</a></h3>
      <p>
        In July 2018, I attended a two-week Duke TIP program at the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute where I completed a 
         project on mapping molecular clouds near Messier 17 with two other students. 
        We collected our own data using an optical telescope and Smiley, a 12-meter radio telescope, that are located on site. 
        At the end of the two-week program, we had to present a poster and a powerpoint presentation to our peers and the faculty at PARI.

      <p>
        During Spring semester 2023, I had to take a spectra of a bright object of my choosing using Rice University's 
        telescope and reduced it using IRAF.
